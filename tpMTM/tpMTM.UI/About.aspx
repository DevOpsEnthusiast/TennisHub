    <h3>Tennis Hub is a non-profit organization run by tennis fanatics. We don&#39;t have money to pay our developers so if you like the site, please click on the DONATE link to help pay their bills.</h3>
    <p>We have been running the operations since 2012. For a long time, we were able to keep the site updated with latest information without any glitch. Since our lead site master left, we&#39;ve been having a hard time finding his successor. I guess, it&#39;s hard to convince someone to work 20 hours a day for free when they can make decent money as a referee or a ball boy at a local club.</p>
